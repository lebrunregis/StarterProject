üìå Which files should I import?
-------------------------------

‚ñ∂ For URP or Built-in Render Pipeline:
   These are included by default ‚Äî no extra package needed.

‚ñ∂ For HDRP:
   If your project uses the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), you must also import the dedicated HDRP package after importing the main package. 
   The HDRP package is located at: 
   Assets/Voxel Labs/Ultimate Preview/Packages/UltimatePreview_HDRP.unitypackage

‚ñ∂ After importing, it is recommended to restart the Unity Editor.

‚ö†Ô∏è Importing the HDRP package into URP or Built-in projects is not necessary and may cause conflicts.
